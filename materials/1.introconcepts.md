# Introduction

## 1.1 Executive Overview

### What is an enterprise?
The TOGAF Standard considers an "enterprise" to be any collection of organizations that have common goals.The term "Enterprise" in the context of "Enterprise Architecture" can be applied to either an entire enterprise, encompassing all of its business activities and capabilities, information, and technology that make up the entire infrastructure and governance of the enterprise, or to one or more specific areas of interest within the enterprise

### Why is an Enterprise Architecture needed?
The purpose of Enterprise Architecture is to optimize across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes (both manual and automated) into an integrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.

### What are the benefits of an Enterprise Architecture?
- More effective strategic decision-making by C-Level executives and business leaders
- More effective and efficient business operations
- More effective and efficient Digital Transformation and operations
- Better return on existing investment, reduced risk for future investment
- Faster, simpler, and cheaper procurement

### What specifically would prompt the development of an Enterprise Architecture?
- Business-driven initiatives to enable business transformation; for example, to leverage digital services and products as revenue generating assets
- Technology-driven initiatives for efficiency and cost reduction; for example, technology consolidation initiatives, where the consolidation destination can be physical, virtual, or a combination
- Merger or acquisition, where the return on investment is only realized after technology efficiencies are realized
- Management of technical debt accrued by agile development initiatives

Often key people identify areas of change required in order for new business goals to be met. Such people are commonly referred to as the "stakeholders" in the change. The role of the architect is to address their concerns by:

- Identifying and refining the requirements of the stakeholders
- Developing views of the architecture that show how the concerns and requirements are going to be addressed
- Showing the trade-offs that are going to be made in reconciling the potentially conflicting concerns of different stakeholders

### What is an architecture framework?
An architecture framework is a foundational structure, or set of structures, which can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures. It should include a method for describing both a baseline and target state of the enterprise, in terms of a set of building blocks for showing how the building blocks fit together and planning the evolution from baseline to target states.A framework is typically tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. Tailoring of the framework should establish a set of tools and a common vocabulary.

### Why use the TOGAF Standard as a framework for Enterprise Architecture?
Using the TOGAF Standard results in Enterprise Architecture that is consistent, reflects the needs of stakeholders, employs best practice, and gives due consideration both to current requirements and the perceived future needs of the business

### Who would benefit from using the TOGAF Standard?
- Organizations seeking Boundaryless Information Flow
- Organizations that design and implement Enterprise Architectures
- Organizations that need to adapt to face new business and market challenges

### When should Enterprise Architecture be done?
To get the greatest benefit from Enterprise Architecture it should be done early and throughout the change process to help decision-makers understand the implications of their decisions
